        <section>
          <h4>Roles</h4>
          <p>Within our team, we divided responsibilites based on every member's unqiue skills and interests. We had a small group of about three members break off to code our login page and connect our LLM, while others got started on figuring out the design and wireframes. Once the log-in was up and running a second group started coding the design based on the wireframe and design guide. Together we all worked to be prompt engineers for our LLM and of course bug hunting was the effort of our entire team! </p>
